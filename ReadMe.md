# About
In this jump 'n' run game you play the crucial role of POWER-UP provider rather than the player. Your mission is straightforward yet electrifying: Supply the player with essential power-ups like the ROCKET üöÄ and SPEED üèÉ to aid their progression through each level. Timing is key in this game üéÆ!
